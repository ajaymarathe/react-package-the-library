# React Package the Library
Hi there, it's small snippets docs to learn about `react package the library`, thanks...

1) `npx create-react-library` - Hit this command, It will ask some questions like package name, license and all... answer's those commands and hit enter it will create library.

2) Library will have following structure -

  ```js
  dist
  example
  src //only do changes in this folder...
  ```
  3) You just have to do you changes in src folder and just `npm start` command and it will serve the project and automatically build the files in `dist` directory.
  
  4) finally hit `npm publish` command to publish your library to npm. Thanks.
